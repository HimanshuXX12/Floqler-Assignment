# 1.Cloneing the Repo inside the local computer
You have to clone the above repo by exceuting the below code 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HimanshuXX12/Floqler-Assignment
```
After cloning you will see three things 
1.Backend Folder
2.frontend react app folder
3.Readme.md

Open the place via vs code and open the terminal of vs code

# 2.Running the Backend
Openthe terminal and execute the below command and enter the Backend Folder
```bash
cd Backend
```

After enterin into the backend excute the below comand to download the Dependicies/node_modules
```bash
npm install
```
After installing the depencies now run the command to start the backend in the local computer
```bash
npm run start
```
The above command will run the server.js file using nodemon.
So till now the Backend Folder is started now move into the frontend folder.

One important things all things i am telling like entering to Backend , Downloading the Depnedcies etc all these codes are to be run  in the vs code terminal and make sure you are in the Backend folder while running in the terminal.

# 3.Frontend
Just like Backend open the termial and run the below command  inside the termial
```bash
cd frontend
```
Now entering into frontent just hit the below command int terminal of vs code  to install dependicies just like we did in Backend
```bash
npm install
```
After installing the dependicies now move to running the react app, for that  run the below code in terminal of vs code
```bash
npm start
```

Till now frontend started and Backend already started so you can see the final product running at port 3000.
